In October, join Christian technologists from across the UK and beyond to share ideas and kick start projects that integrate our Christian faith and  technical skill sets.\n\nWhether you’re a developer, designer, project manager, branding/marketing expert, ideator or something else entirely, enjoy taking a weekend to meet and work with others who share your desire to see God glorified through technology.\nHere’s what people have said about previous BUILD events:\n\n\"I got to work on [solving] a problem for Christians Against Poverty that could be genuinely useful… while learning new front-end technologies.\n\"Seeing the excitement and passion in people as they took ideas from conception to a presentable prototype was inspiring.\"\n\"It was such a highlight to meet other Christian developers and discussing God centered technologies.\" \n\n\n\nBUILD 2019 is being hosted by St. John’s in Hoxton.\nSt. John’s sits minutes away from Silicon Roundabout, London’s tech hub. They have long been a supporter of Kingdom Code and we’re really excited to be able to host the hackathon with them.\n\n\nDetails about the 2019 challenges are coming soon, however to whet your appetite, check out some of the challenges from previous events: \nIn 2017 Christians Against Poverty asked us “how can digital tools enable churches to serve the poor and save the lost in their local communities?” Home for Good asked “how could Home for Good better use digital tools to inspire people, support them in their fostering and adoption journey and enable them to be part of a growing movement?\n\n\nFriday 11th October\n18:00 | Doors open and registration18:30 | Dinner19:15 | Welcome, worship and project pitches20:30 | Team formation and hack time\nSaturday 12th October\n08:30 | Breakfast and team bible studies13:00 | Lunch16:30 | Project deadline17:30 | Dinner18:45 | Presentations20:00 | Voting20:20 | Awards and final words21:00 | Event close\n(please note that these timings are estimates and may change nearer the event)\n\n\nWhy are we charging for this event?Ticket sales will cover less than half the cost. The hackathon in London is hosted by Kingdom Code, a not-for-profit group, with a passion to help Christians in technology find encouragement and collaborate. Over half the budget will be met by the generosity of sponsors.\nAre you going to feed me?Yes! You'll be well fed over the course of the weekend. We'll eat together Friday dinner through to Saturday evening. There will be plenty of snacks and caffeine on tap.\nIs there a student discount?Maybe... if you ask nicely! Snap a photo of your student ID / NUS card and send us a tweet (@kcodeuk) and we'll see what we can do for you.\nWhere can I contact the organiser with any questions?Kingdom Code is on Facebook and Twitter, send us a message there and we'll get back to you ASAP.\nCan I update my registration information?Yes! Just log into Eventbrite and update your information.\nI heard rumours of a cat...Alas, not this year. The new venue has no church cat (maybe a few church mice though…)\nAre there refunds?Sorry, we can't do refunds, however the tickets are transferable, so feel free to pass your ticket on to someone else (just remember to update the name on the ticket).\nIs there an age limit for the event?There is no age limit for the event, however under 18's must be accompanied by a legal guardian and cannot stay overnight.\n24 hours? What about sleep?While some people will be working for the full 24 hours (caffeine provided in the ticket cost) it is certainly not expected! Don't worry you can go to sleep. We've set aside seperate rooms (including the church crypt) to put out a rollmat and catch some",

At 9:15 everyone introduces themselves and briefly describes what brought them to CODE + BREWS today (projects, homework, networking, etc). \n2. For the rest of the day, folks work in the communal space on their projects providing one another help and conversation as needed. Oh and they usually drink coffee and tea too!\nWhere is the event? October's CODE + BREWS will be at the Wisconsin Center. Metered street parking is available near by the venue. \nHow often will we gather?The first Saturday of every month. \nWho can attend? If you want to code (anything) and are at any skill level CODE + BREWS is for you. We are an inclusive group, focused on sharing skills and building Milwaukee's developer community. \nWho is helping promote this event? We are not a meetup or user group so we have partnered with local groups to help us promote and build CODE + BREWS community. Those groups include Code for Milwaukee, Girl Develop It Milwaukee, Greater Milwaukee Java Meetup, Milwaukee Azure, Milwaukee JS, Wisconsin .NET User Group.\nWho is hosting this event? CODE + BREWS is hosted by Joe Murphy, Lead Frontend Developer @ Wantable Maggie Fernandes, Software Developer @ MacGregor Partners and Matt Cordio founder of Startup Milwaukee and Skills Pipeline. \nWe're always looking for local companies to host future gatherings in the mornings over coffee or evenings over beer. ",

Processing.js is a JavaScript library for Processing - which is a powerful open source language (as well as an application) commonly used to explore how complex algorithms and systems work in a visual context. It allows us to take data and create projects like data visualizations, animations, digital artwork, and games that are also easy to share on the web. \r\n\r\nWhat will you learn at this workshop? \r\nWe’ll go over how to code simple mathematical equations and change variables, integers, colours, and shapes to create unique and engaging outcomes. We’ll also explore large amounts of data - specifically hashtags from Twitter and campaign reports from Mailchimp - and use ProcessingJS to create easy-to-understand visualizations based on our findings. As a bonus, we'll show you how to publish your live and interactive creation to the web, and share next steps on collecting your own sets of data outside of the workshop. \r\n\r\nSpecifically, we will cover the following:\r\nAn overview of JavaScript\r\nAn overview of ProcessingJS, why it's cool, and how you can use it in the workplace\r\nHow to import a .csv file containing large amounts of data into ProcessingJS\r\nHow to grab data from the .csv file and visually display it using geometrical shapes\r\nWhat a variable is, an integer and a float, and how these can be slightly changed to make a simple shape look more interesting and complex\r\nHow to integrate basic user interaction in order to navigate around your data (and be able to see some cool animations!)\r\nCoding in RGB colour, and the importance of colour in data visualizations\n\nWho is this for?\nOur Ladies Learning Code workshops offer female-identified and male-identified, trans, and non-binary adults hands-on, project-based learning experiences that are designed to give beginners the skills and confidence they need to become digital creators.\n\nPrerequisites:\nNone!
